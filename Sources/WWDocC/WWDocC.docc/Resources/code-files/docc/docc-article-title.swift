# Getting Started with Sloths

Create a sloth and assign personality traits and abilities.

## Overview

Sloths are complex creatures that require careful creation and a suitable habitat. After creating a sloth, you're responsible for feeding them, providing fulfilling activities, and giving them opportunities to exercise and rest.

Every sloth has a ``Sloth/name`` and ``Sloth/color-swift.property``. You can optionally provide a ``Sloth/power-swift.property`` if your sloth has special supernatural abilities.
