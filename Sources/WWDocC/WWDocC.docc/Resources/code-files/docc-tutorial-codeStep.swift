			@Step {
				Create a new SwiftUI View file named `CustomizedSlothView.swift`.

				@Code(name: "CustomizedSlothView.swift", file: 01-creating-code-02-01.swift) {
					@Image(source: preview-01-creating-code-02-01.png, alt: "A screenshot from the Xcode preview as it would appear on iPhone, with the text, Hello, World!, centered in the middle of the display.")
				}
			}

			@Step {
				Import the `SlothCreator` package.

				@Code(name: "CustomizedSlothView.swift", file: 01-creating-code-02-02.swift) {
					@Image(source: preview-01-creating-code-02-01.png, alt: "A screenshot from the Xcode preview as it would appear on iPhone, with the text, Hello, World!, centered in the middle of the display.")
				}
			}

			@Step {
				Create a ``SlothCreator/Sloth`` state variable called `sloth`.

				@Code(name: "CustomizedSlothView.swift", file: 01-creating-code-02-03.swift) {
					@Image(source: preview-01-creating-code-02-01.png, alt: "A screenshot from the Xcode preview as it would appear on iPhone, with the text, Hello, World!, centered in the middle of the display.")
				}
